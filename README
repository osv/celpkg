Package manager
---------------

 UNIX
-------

You need tcl/tk with BWidget, wget.  (Almost all dependencies can be installed
if you install tkabber for example).

GUI interface:

  %wish8.5 celpkgk.tcl

Command line:

  %tclsh celpkg.tcl

Command line interface not ready for use. To configure directories and
url of repository you still need to launch GUI (celpkgk).

 Windows
--------

You may  is use  Cygwin (binutils, tcl/tk,  wget, Bwidget you  need to
manually   install),   OR   you   can  download   binary   pack   from
http://celpkg.sf.net
